# Meira

Meira is a web framework written in Nim.

It is a modified version of [Mummy](https://github.com/guzba/mummy), a
multi-threaded HTTP 1.1 and WebSocket server by Ryan Oldenburg, and also
includes pieces of code from the Jester web framework that have been adapted to
work with Mummy.

The word Meira (ミイラ) means "mummy" in Japanese.
