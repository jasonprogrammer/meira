## This example shows a basic chat server over WebSocket.
##
## To try the example, run the server (nim c -r examples/chat.nim)
## then open a few tabs to http://localhost:8080
##
## Each tab can send messages and they'll be received by all tabs.
##
## This file includes the HTML being sent to the client as a string. In a real
## web app, you'd probably have this in a file or served some other way.
## I'm just keeping everything in one file and as simple as possible.
